<h1>Book Pickup & Delivery Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 24, 2025</p>
<p>Readar is a local community-based book sharing platform. Books are exchanged through in-person pickups arranged between buyers and sellers. This policy outlines how book handovers work.</p>

<h2>Platform Model</h2>
<p>Readar facilitates <strong>peer-to-peer book exchanges</strong>. We do not warehouse, ship, or deliver books. All physical exchanges are coordinated directly between users.</p>

<h2>Pickup Process</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reservation:</strong> Buyer reserves a book and pays the full price through PhonePe</li>
<li><strong>Seller Confirmation:</strong> Seller confirms book availability and pickup readiness</li>
<li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Buyer and seller coordinate pickup location and time through the platform</li>
<li><strong>Exchange:</strong> Buyer picks up the book at the agreed location</li>
<li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Seller marks the book as collected in the platform</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pickup Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sellers must make books available within <strong>7 days</strong> of reservation confirmation</li>
<li>Buyers must pick up books within <strong>7 days</strong> of seller's availability confirmation</li>
<li>If pickup does not occur within this timeframe, either party may request cancellation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pickup Locations</h2>
<p>Sellers may choose pickup locations such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public places (coffee shops, libraries, bookstores)</li>
<li>Residential areas (with mutual agreement)</li>
<li>Community centers or local landmarks</li>
</ul>
<p>For safety, we recommend meeting in public, well-lit locations.</p>

<h2>Book Rentals</h2>
<p>For rented books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pickup process is the same as purchases</li>
<li>Return must be coordinated within the rental period</li>
<li>Late returns may incur additional fees</li>
<li>Books must be returned in the same condition</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always meet in public, populated areas</li>
<li>Inform someone about your meeting location and time</li>
<li>Verify the book condition before completing the exchange</li>
<li>Use the platform's messaging system to coordinate details</li>
<li>Never share personal financial information outside the platform</li>
</ul>

<h2>Delivery Options (Future)</h2>
<p>While Readar currently supports only local pickups, we are exploring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional courier delivery for users willing to pay shipping costs</li>
<li>Partnerships with local delivery services</li>
<li>Community drop-off points</li>
</ul>
<p>These features will be announced when available.</p>

<h2>Issues with Pickup</h2>
<p>If you encounter problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seller No-Show:</strong> Report through the platform; may be eligible for refund</li>
<li><strong>Book Condition Mismatch:</strong> You may reject the book and request refund with evidence</li>
<li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> Report inappropriate behavior immediately</li>
<li><strong>Communication Issues:</strong> Contact support for assistance</li>
</ul>
